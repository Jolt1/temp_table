# temp_table
<h2>A quick and easy tool to import a spreadsheet as a table in a database.</h2><br>
I created this tool because i often needed to quickly add data to my DB provided by clients in spreadsheets.

<b>How To use:</b>
<ol>
  <li>First update db.php with your database's login info. (lines  4-7)</li>
  <li>Launch index.php on your server</li>
  <li>Browse for your spreadsheet file & Upload</li>
  <li>Your Done! your new tabel is ready to use.</li>
 </ol>
 
 


This tool's functioanlity for reading the spreadsheets is based on the PHP Spreadsheest repo and is included with version 1.6.0 as of 1/21/2019. You may choose to update to a newer version if availible.<br>
