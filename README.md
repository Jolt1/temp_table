<h2>A quick and easy tool to import a spreadsheet as a table in a MySQL database.</h2><br>

Works with most spreadsheet formats including CSV & XLSX

  <li>Launch index.php on your server</li>
  <li>Browse for your spreadsheet file & Upload</li>
  <li>Your Done! your new tabel is ready to use.</li>
 </ol>
